# Brazillian Jiu-Jitsu State Machine

I'm playing with [@stonecypher](https://github.com/StoneCypher)'s Javascript finite state machine language, [jssm](https://github.com/StoneCypher/jssm), to describe a jiu-jitsu game plan: starting from either non-engaged state (pulling guard or initiating a pass) and moving through some transitions leading up to a submission hold.
